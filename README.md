# node-command-line-weather

A node.js command line tool that accepts a zip code as an argument and returns basic weather information.

To use, download the repo, add your forecast.io api key in the app.js file, and run ```node app.js *zipcode*```

To get weather for Portland, ME: ```node app.js 04101```

Inspired by an "extra credit" assignment at the end of Treehouse's Node.js basics course.
